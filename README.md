## TransContactHiC â€“ a tool to detect trans-homologous chromatin contacts in phased Hi-C data

TransContactHiC is written in Python, and accompanied by a Snakemake pipeline and Jupyter notebooks to re-analyze published in situ Hi-C data for heterozygotic _D. melanogaster_ cells: embryos and a fully differentiated cell line. A preprint on bioRxiv will appear soon.

General directory structure:
* `config/` contains the central `config.yml` file.
* `data/` will contain all the source sequencing data (downloaded from GEO), as well as processed data.
* `doc/` contains documentation material.
* `env/` contains specifications of Conda environments.
* `results/` will contain results generated by the data analysis code found in `src/`.
* `src/` contains all the code to perform the analyses: Python programs (TransContactHiC and helper tools), Snakemake pipelines and Jupyter notebooks.

See `./run_snakemake.sh` for an example Snakemake invocation.
