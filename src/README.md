# Jupyter notebooks

The code used to perform the analysis of the indentified cis- and transh-homologous contacts is availabe in jupyter notebooks. Suggested order of notebooks execution and their contents is as follows:
1. Contacts_numbers_Dmel.ipynb: calculates basic statistics for cish and transh interactions. Associated with Figure 1.  
2. DESeq2_and_contacts_clustering.ipynb: identification and counting of the transh-up and transh-down bin triads, clustering of transh contacts (Figure 2, Figure 3 A-C). 
3. DNase-seq_peaks_transh_dist.ipynb: distances from cish and transh interactions to closest DNase-seq peaks (Figure 3 D-E). 
4. SNPs_and_motifs.ipynb: influence of SNPs located in transh-up and transh-down bin triads on TF motif instances (Figure 4).
5. Prepare_tracks.ipynb: code used to prepare the IGV tracks (Figure 2E and 4E).
